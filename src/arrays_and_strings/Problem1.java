	 * Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters

	// Assume that the string contains only lower case letters. Then form a 
	// hash table with the chars as keys and keep adding the chars to the hash
	// until you find that it was already inserted earlier. A simple form 
	// of hash table would be using a boolean array with the ascii values of the 
	// chars as the indices into the array.
